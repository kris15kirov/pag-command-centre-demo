## ðŸŽ¯ **Implemented Based on Grok's Feedback**

### âœ… **1. Web3-Specific Categorization System**

- **High Priority Keywords**: Added Web3-specific terms like "defi", "nft", "smart contract", "protocol", "token", "blockchain", "crypto", "web3", "dao", "governance"
- **Project Mentions**: Automatic high-priority categorization for messages mentioning audited projects

**Audited Projects Database:**
```python
AUDITED_PROJECTS = {
    "dex": ["Uniswap", "Sushi", "PancakeSwap", "dYdX"],
    "lending": ["Aave", "Compound", "MakerDAO"],
    "stablecoin": ["USDC", "USDT", "DAI", "FRAX"],
